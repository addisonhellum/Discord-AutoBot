# Discord-AutoBot
Use artificial intelligence to automatically generate scripts to perform actions on your Discord account.

**auto-code.py** - This is the main file to run. It will ask what tasks you want the bot to perform, generate the necessary code, save the code to a temporary file, and execute the code live.

**discord_bot_client.py** - This is a wrapped Discord SDK. Define functions to take actions on behalf of your Discord account.

**example.py** - This shows the AI bot to use the custom, wrapped Discord SDK (discord_bot_client.py). If you add new functions, give an example of their usage in this file.
